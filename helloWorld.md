## Creating Your First Python Program Using VS Code

If you've just installed Python and want to create your first program, don't worry! It's easy to get started. Here's a step-by-step guide for creating your first Python program using VS Code.

1. Open VS Code on your computer.

2. Click on "File" and select "New File" to create a new file.

3. Save the file with a `.py` extension. For example, you could save it as `hello.py`.

4. In the new file, type the following code:

   ```
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

   This code will simply print the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console.

5. Save the file.

6. Open the Terminal in VS Code by clicking on "Terminal" in the menu bar and selecting "New Terminal".

7. In the Terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved your Python file. For example, if you saved your file in the `Documents` folder, type `cd Documents` in the Terminal.

8. Once you're in the correct directory, type `python hello.py` in the Terminal and press Enter.

9. The output "Hello, World!" should appear in the Terminal. Congratulations, you've just run your first Python program!

This simple program is just the beginning of what you can do with Python. As you continue to learn, you'll be able to write more complex programs and explore the many capabilities of Python. Keep practicing and have fun!
